asciicast takes an R script and turns it into an
[asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) cast. It can simulate typing, and
records all terminal output in real time as it happens.

## Features

* Input is an R script, output is a
  [v2 asciicast recording](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema/blob/develop/doc/asciicast-v2.md).
* Record all terminal output in real time, as it happens.
* Simulate typing in the commands, with a configurable, randomized speed.
* Alternatively, whole comment blocks or expressions can just appear on
  the screen.
* Convert casts to SVG images using
  [svg-term](https://github.com/marionebl/svg-term). The package comes with
  its own svg-term bundle, no external dependencies are needed.
* Render a single frame of a cast as an SVG image.
* Configurable delay at the beginning, at the end and between paragraphs.
* [HTML widget](http://www.htmlwidgets.org), to be used in Rmarkdown
  documents, e.g. in vignettes.
* Read casts from asciinema JSON files (version 2), or from
  <https://asciinema.org> directly.
* Special knitr engine to create R markdown files with ascii casts. See
  the `asciicast-demo` vignette.
* Create ascii casts in GitHub READMEs via animated SVG files. See an
  example in `inst/examples` or the `README.Rmd` source of the README
  file you are reading.

## Limitations

* asciicast does not work in Windows yet, but Windows support is coming soon.
* asciicast needs an R build that contains a shared or static R library.
  This is true for most R builds currently.

## Installation

You can install the released version of asciicast from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org):

``` r
install.packages("asciicast")
```

## Examples

See the [`inst/examples` directory](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/asciicast/tree/main/inst/examples)
for these examples.

### Hello world

The input script:

```{r code = readLines("inst/examples/hello.R"), eval = FALSE}
```

The result:

```{asciicast, code = readLines("inst/examples/hello.R"), cache = TRUE}
```

### Asciicast demo in asciicast

Input script that uses asciicast itself:

```{r code = readLines("inst/examples/asciicast.R"), eval = FALSE}
```

```{asciicast, code = readLines("inst/examples/asciicast.R"), cache = TRUE}
```

### Errors are recorded

Input script with errors:

```{r code = readLines("inst/examples/errors.R"), eval = FALSE}
```

```{asciicast, code = readLines("inst/examples/errors.R"), cache = TRUE}
```
