# development version

* The `asciinema_player()` HTML widget now properly sets the height and
  width of the player window, using the `height` and `width` parameters
  of the cast.

* `record()` now works with script files that end with a comment line (#13).

* The initial R prompt is now not left out when recording a cast.

* `asciinema_player()` now creates an HTML widget that works well on
  Firefox as well.
